// Vendored is the embedded Jackett definition snapshot. Do not edit files under
// vendor/ — they are vendored byte-for-byte. See docs/ideas.md "Definition
// lifecycle". The `all:` prefix ensures dotfiles (e.g. .jackett-ref) are
// included so provenance ships with the binary.

// DropInDir is the on-disk directory (relative to the configured data dir) where
// users place override definitions that take precedence over Vendored. The
// loader resolves precedence as: dropin > vendored, keyed by definition id.
